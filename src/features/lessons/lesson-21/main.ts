// ============================================================
// Lesson 21 page — "Keys and the circle of fifths", in reading order
// ============================================================
//
// learn/21.html carries every word of the lesson; this module adds what the
// markup cannot. A written lesson with no film, so there is no Watch section
// and the masthead's anchors are Lesson, Sing and Explorer. The hero is the
// cold open, in Lesson 2's order: the hook, the stage, the sound gate and the
// predict, then the recall (FACTS 5a), which asks Lesson 6's and Lesson 15's
// own questions. One object carries the lesson: Lesson 2's ring of twelve
// beads, which the steps thread by fifths into the circle of fifths. Merc
// and Tavi's renderer loads last, as its own chunk, so the page reads before
// it arrives. A theory lesson with an unscored sing-along, so a draft until
// Lessons 6 and 15 are live and the vocal coach has looked at Sing it
// (kit/drafts.ts).
//
// Season 2's page: it carries its season before anything draws
// (kit/page-state.ts `carrySeason`), so the masthead, the explorer, its
// links and the next-lesson card know Lessons 15 to 28, and the explorer
// opens on Season 2's tab. On this page a staff is always music: no section
// head carries the faint staff and its clef (no `engraveClefs`), and the
// body's `season-2` class drops the background's (WEB-SPEC, Look).
