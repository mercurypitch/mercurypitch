# Changelog

What's new in MercuryPitch, in plain terms. For the full, detailed
engineering history see [`dev-changelog.md`](./dev-changelog.md).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Practice Intelligence**: difficulty that adapts to your level on every exercise, targeted drills for your weakest notes, and a trends dashboard with a practice-streak calendar.
- **Pitch accuracy heatmap**: see how cleanly you sang each note, and click a note to jump there.
- **Smoother, faster UI**: loading placeholders for lazy panels and gentle transition animations.
- **Onboarding survey**: a quick, optional survey to help shape the app.
- **Accessibility**: keyboard focus handling, screen-reader labels, larger touch targets, and reduced-motion support.

### Changed

- **Server-authoritative leaderboard**: rankings are now derived from your real practice sessions (tamper-proof), with global, friends, all-time and weekly views.

### Fixed

- Sign-in and password-manager autofill polish, plus a batch of karaoke, lyrics and UI fixes.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-11

- **Vocal Analysis & Shazam Sing**: analyze your recorded vocals, and identify songs by singing them.
