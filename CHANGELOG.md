# Changelog

What's new in MercuryPitch, in plain terms. For the full, detailed
engineering history see [`dev-changelog.md`](./dev-changelog.md).

## [0.4.5] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Beginner help on every exercise**: a "?" button in the top-left explains, in plain words, what each exercise is (what a long note, slide, or vibrato actually is), how to do it, and what's being scored.
- **Timed auto-score mode** for the held-note exercises (Long Note, Vibrato, Pitch Hold): pick a 5s, 15s or 30s timer and the exercise scores itself when the time is up — no need to reach for Stop.
- **A guide dot for slides**: the Slide exercise now shows a dot that glides up and down so you can follow the pitch path with your voice.

### Changed

- **Clearer exercise screens**: the Start button now sits beneath the exercise description, and after you finish there's a single, obvious next action instead of two competing "Try Again" buttons.
- **Easier-to-read text**: lightened the faint gray text on the Challenges tab and the exercise score panel so labels, badges and results are legible.
- **Smarter pitch tracker zoom**: when you sing within about one octave, the tracker now zooms in to that octave instead of showing three or four, so your pitch line is easier to follow.

### Fixed

- **Vibrato is now detected properly**: the Vibrato exercise (and the Vocal Analysis vibrato readout) often failed to recognize a real vibrato; it now reads your pitch correctly and scores it.
- **More accurate exercise scoring**: several exercises (Siren, Drone, Staccato, Interval Trainer, Sight-Singing, Routine Runner, Pitch Hold) measured the recent part of your take using a wrong assumption about timing, which could skew scores — they now use the real timeline.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Changing your display name on a cloud account now works — it was failing with an error because the app tried to update a leaderboard table that's no longer there. The leaderboard already picks up your new name automatically.

## [0.4.3] - 2026-06-26

### Fixed

- Cloud accounts now work on mercurypitch.com — the production build was shipping without its API configuration, so accounts fell back to on-device storage.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-06-25

### Fixed

- Shazam Sing: the button icons (Speech/Debug toggles, Stop & Match, Cancel, and "Upload audio instead") are sized correctly again instead of looking oversized.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-25

### Added

- **Guided tours for every tab**: interactive spotlight tours (Guitar, Piano, Karaoke, Analysis, Exercises, Jam, Community, Leaderboard, Challenges), each offered once and re-startable from the sidebar, all listed in the Guide menu.
- **Learn tutorials for every feature**: read-along guides for each tab, with a one-click "Take the interactive tour" jump from a tutorial to its spotlight tour.
- **Clearer mic feedback**: a single, steady hint when we can't hear you or you're too quiet to read — now on Singing, Karaoke, Piano, Guitar and Jam.
- **Karaoke pitch overlay**: optionally draw a red line of your own pitch over the vocal track, and label the notes you sang.
- **Find My Voice**: starts listening as soon as it opens and waits for a steady "Ah" (no Start button to miss); the button in Settings is easier to spot.

### Changed

- **Exercises**: compact, centered card gallery with skill pills; practice suggestions and recent sessions grouped at the top, with a "Get started" nudge for newcomers.

### Fixed

- Score-card button icons are aligned, the Karaoke header shows the song length instead of the session id, and the share link is hidden until cloud song sync ships.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added

- **Practice Intelligence**: difficulty that adapts to your level on every exercise, targeted drills for your weakest notes, and a trends dashboard with a practice-streak calendar.
- **Pitch accuracy heatmap**: see how cleanly you sang each note, and click a note to jump there.
- **Smoother, faster UI**: loading placeholders for lazy panels and gentle transition animations.
- **Onboarding survey**: a quick, optional survey to help shape the app.
- **Accessibility**: keyboard focus handling, screen-reader labels, larger touch targets, and reduced-motion support.

### Changed

- **Server-authoritative leaderboard**: rankings are now derived from your real practice sessions (tamper-proof), with global, friends, all-time and weekly views.

### Fixed

- Sign-in and password-manager autofill polish, plus a batch of karaoke, lyrics and UI fixes.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- **Karaoke / Stem Mixer**: upload a song, split it into vocal and instrumental stems, and sing along to synced LRC lyrics with A/B looping — plus playlist "set list" mode with per-singer scoring.
- **16 singing exercises** with daily warm-up routines and shareable links.
- **Vocal Analysis & Shazam Sing**: analyze your recorded vocals, and identify songs by singing them.
- **Jam Sessions**: real-time peer-to-peer practice rooms with video, chat and a shared exercise canvas.
- **Cloud accounts & sync**: anonymous-first accounts, upgradeable to email/password or Google, with progress synced across devices.

### Changed

- Moved storage to IndexedDB for reliability and capacity.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-09

### Added

- **Piano practice mode** with visual note feedback.
- **Vocal separation (UVR)** to isolate vocals and instrumentals.
- Improved pitch detection and a "What's New" changelog.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-03

### Added

- Initial MercuryPitch release: a piano-roll melody editor, real-time pitch detection with accuracy scoring, vocal-technique effects, instrument sounds, shareable preset URLs, dark/light themes, and playback-speed control.
